# Remove this repo's stopped CI leftovers on the runner host.

#
# v1 (ci-template v1.18, dept-infra 2026-10-12). An integration job's
# `if: always()` teardown runs only while the job process lives. When the host
# or its Docker daemon dies mid-job, the job is gone and so is its teardown: the
# compose stack stays behind, exited, with its networks and volumes. Nothing
# else removes them, so the first step of every job that starts containers
# runs this.
#
# What it removes, on the Docker host the job talks to:
#   - a compose project (label com.docker.compose.project) whose name starts
#     with <prefix>, when EVERY container in it is stale; then the project's
#     networks and volumes (same label);
#   - a container outside compose whose name starts with <prefix>, when stale,
#     with its anonymous volumes.
# Stale: exited or dead and finished at least <min-age-seconds> ago, or
# created and never started at least that long ago. A project with any
# container running, paused, restarting or removing is never touched.
#
# <min-age-seconds> defaults to 11100: the runners' 3h job timeout plus 5 min,
# so no job that could still own the stack is alive. Pass the job's own
# timeout-minutes * 60 plus a margin only if you know every runner's timeout.
#
# The prefix is this repo's own, `go-trusted-platform-ci-`: the name the jobs
# give their compose projects and toolchain containers, without the run id.
#
# A failed removal is reported and skipped: the reaper never fails the job.
# REAP_DRY_RUN=1 prints what would be removed and removes nothing.
